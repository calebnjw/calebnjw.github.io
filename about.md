title: caleb ng â€” about
---
caleb graduated from the [singapore university of technology and design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) with a bachelor of science in architecture in 2019.

as a person, he is interested in design as a whole, but tends to focus more on the visual aspect. he chose architecture as his major, because he wanted to challenge himself.

he was. and came out feeling rather defeated.
