# calebnjw.github.io
This is the portfolio site of caleb ng, hosted on github. Currently (21 Oct 2019), this page is hardcoded, and features no portfolio as yet (besides a link to a pdf of my portfolio). 

## Future
I will be working to build this page using Jekyll, and also shift content from the pdf here. And give the option to download a pdf separately. 

The homepage should be scrollable, and hint at the portfolio below.
